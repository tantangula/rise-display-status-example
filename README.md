# rise-display-status-example
This is an example to show how Rise Vision's Core API can be used to monitor the status of a company's display.

The live demo of this site is being hosted at http://45.55.74.55/Rise/.

To use the site, log in with a Google account that is linked to a company in Rise Vision. Then, the page will pull all of your diplay information from Rise Vision using their Core API. All of your company's displays will be listed. You can click on a display name to show more detailed information about that display.

This code will not work if you host it yourself until you go through the process of creating a OAuth token in Google's developer console and link it with Rise Vision's developer console. If you have any specific questions on that process you can always post in the Rise Vision community, and I can try to help work through any issues there.
